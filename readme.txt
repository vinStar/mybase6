1. What's myBase
============================

myBase is a unique freeform database that can create, store and organize 
information in the form of rich text, web pages, image files, and even 
binary files. Information is compressed with an integrated zip utility 
and stored in a tree-structured full-text searchable database. myBase is 
based on an extremely fast and stable freeform database engine, provides 
a uncluttered user interface, and supports add-on/plug-in API. And now a 
substantial number of powerful add-ons/plug-ins are available. The existing 
add-ons/plug-ins greatly expanded the capabilities of myBase. For example, 
with the WebCollect add-on, you'll have the convenience of capturing entire 
or a portion of webpage directly from your web browser; With the HtmlTree
plug-in, you'll be able to convert your database into a professional looking 
HTML tree and a set of web pages with one click. For more info,
